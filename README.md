Osteoporosis Risk Prediction


This project focuses on predicting osteoporosis risk using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook titled Osteoporosis Risk Prediction.ipynb. It includes steps such as data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

OVERVIEW

Osteoporosis is a medical condition where bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model using clinical and demographic data that can assess an individual's risk of osteoporosis. Early identification of high-risk individuals can help in timely medical interventions, improving patient outcomes.

REQUIREMENTS

Jupyter Notebook: For running the .ipynb file.
Required Python Libraries:
pandas

PROJECT WORKFLOW
The project workflow is as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and relationships within the data.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them.
Normalize or scale numerical features to standardize data.
Encode categorical variables as needed.


Feature Engineering:

Select important features based on correlation or domain knowledge.
Create new features if necessary to improve model performance.


Model Building:

Train multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Use training and testing datasets to evaluate model performance.


Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.


Results and Insights:

Summarize the key findings, such as feature importance rankings and model performance metrics.
Visualize results using graphs like confusion matrices and ROC curves.


RESULTS


The predictive model achieves high accuracy and recall in identifying individuals at risk of osteoporosis.
Key insights include:
Important predictors of osteoporosis.
Model evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy scores, and ROC curves).
